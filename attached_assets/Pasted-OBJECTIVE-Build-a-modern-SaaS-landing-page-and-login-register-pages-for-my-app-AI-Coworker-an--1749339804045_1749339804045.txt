OBJECTIVE:
Build a modern SaaS landing page and login/register pages for my app “AI Coworker” — an AI assistant for professionals. Replicate the visual and interaction design of https://www.flank.ai/, focusing on clean layout, advanced polish, high responsiveness, and smooth animation.

VISUAL STYLE:
- Color palette: Light background with gray tones, blue/green accents
- Typography: Inter or similar sans-serif, large bold headlines, clear body text
- Layout: Wide containers with maximum whitespace, consistent vertical spacing
- Component style: Rounded corners (2xl), subtle shadows, crisp padding, responsive grid layout

TECH STACK:
- React with Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui for consistent and styled components
- Framer Motion for smooth animations and transitions
- Fully responsive using Tailwind breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl)
- Animate on scroll using Framer Motion and IntersectionObserver via `useInView`

SITE STRUCTURE:
Pages:
- `/`: Marketing landing page
- `/login`: Login form
- `/register`: Registration form
- `/dashboard`: Placeholder for future SaaS interface

Landing Page Sections (in order):
1. Sticky navigation bar with logo and buttons ("Login", "Try AI Coworker")
2. Hero section:
   - Title and subheading on the left
   - Call-to-action button
   - Animated graphic or Lottie visual on the right with entrance animation
3. Features section:
   - 3 or 4 cards in a responsive grid or scrollable row
   - Staggered animations as each card comes into view
4. Problem/Solution explanation with alternating text/image sections
5. Use case switcher or tabbed section for industries (e.g. legal, sales, support)
6. Testimonial section with horizontally scrollable or auto-rotating text quotes
7. Pricing section:
   - 3-tier comparison layout with hover effects and call-to-action buttons
8. Footer:
   - Newsletter/email capture
   - Text-only navigation links (no icons required)
   - Terms, privacy policy links

UX AND ANIMATION DETAILS:
- Navbar changes background and shadow after scrolling past the hero
- Smooth scroll animations via Framer Motion (fade-in, y-position entrance)
- Buttons have hover scale and color transition
- Feature cards animate on scroll with `opacity: 0 → 1`, `y: 20 → 0`
- Responsive layout must adapt down to mobile screens
- Mobile nav uses a toggle menu or drawer (text-based, no icons required)

COMPONENTS TO BUILD:
- Navbar.tsx
- HeroSection.tsx
- FeatureCard.tsx
- PricingSection.tsx
- Testimonials.tsx
- Footer.tsx
- LoginForm.tsx
- RegisterForm.tsx

CONTENT:
Use placeholders like:
- "AI Coworker helps professionals automate tasks, summarize meetings, and follow up on emails."
- Dummy features and plans: Free, Pro, Enterprise
- Testimonials and pricing can be lorem ipsum or fake until real content is provided

DEPLOYMENT:
Ensure the result is optimized for Vercel deployment. Focus on fast load performance, minimal hydration delay, and production-grade animation smoothness.

Start by scaffolding the Tailwind + React project with file structure, basic routing, and the top-level layout wrapper.
